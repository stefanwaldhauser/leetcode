#     First loop to build frequency map:
#     - Iterates through nums array once
#     - Dictionary operations are O(1)
#     - Time: O(n) where n is length of nums

#     Building heap array and heapification:
#     - Iterates through unique numbers in num_to_freq
#     - heapify operation is O(m) where m is number of unique elements
#     - Time: O(m) where m is number of unique elements

#     Final loop for extracting k elements:
#     - Performs k heappop operations
#     - Each heappop is O(log m)
#     - Time: O(k log m)


# Total Runtime: O(n + m + k log m) where:
# - n is length of input array
# - m is number of unique elements
# - k is given parameter

# Since m â‰¤ n(number of unique elements can't exceed array length), we can simplify to:
# O(n + k log n)

# Space Complexity:
# - Dictionary: O(m)
# - Heap: O(m)
# - Solution array: O(k)
# Total Space: O(m) or O(n) in worst case
